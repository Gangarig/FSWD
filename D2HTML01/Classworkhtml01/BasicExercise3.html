    <h1>Love the Way You Lie - Eminem</h1>

    <div>
        <p>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
            Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
            Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
            Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
            <span>love the way you lie</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            I can't tell you what it really is<br>
            I can only tell you what it feels like<br>
            And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe<br>
            I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight<br>
            As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight<br>
            High off of love, drunk from her hate<br>
            It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer<br>
            I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown<br>
            She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me<br>
            And I love it, "Wait<br>
            Where you going?" "I'm leaving you"<br>
            "No you ain't, come back"<br>
            We're running right back, here we go again<br>
            It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great<br>
            I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane<br>
            But when it's bad, it's awful<br>
            I feel so ashamed, I snapped, "Who's that dude?"<br>
            I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her<br>
            I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>
            Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
            Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
            Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
            Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
            <span>I love the way you lie</span><br>
            <span>love the way you lie</span>
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
            Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
            Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
            Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
            <span>I love the way you lie</span><br>
            <span>I love the way you lie</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean<br>
            Then we fall back into the same patterns<br>
            Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is<br>
            You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded<br>
            Baby, please come back, it wasn't you<br>
            Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems<br>
            Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano<br>
            All I know is I love you too much to walk away though<br>
            Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk<br>
            Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?<br>
            Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball<br>
            Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall<br>
            Next time? There won't be no next time<br>
            I apologize, even though I know it's lies<br>
            I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar<br>
            If she ever tries to fucking leave again<br>
            I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
    </div>

            Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
            Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
            Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
            Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
            <span>I love the way you lie</span><br>
            <span>I love the way you lie</span>
